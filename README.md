## About the User <!-- This is a scaled down user persona -->
- The ideal user for this application is someone the reads a lot
- They like to shop online for new books
- The problem this app solves for them is it allows them to see their own books online, create new books and authors, and allows the user to delete them.

## Features <!-- List your app features using bullets! Do NOT use a paragraph. No one will read that! -->
- When a new author or book as created, they are added to their respective arrays, and displayed on the DOM
- There is a page in which you can view all the books, and page that displays all the authors with pictures.
- Users can login and out, and they will only see the books and authors that they have created
- Users can add, update, and delete authors with all their books.
